Here I am
And within the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep and she's sweeter now
Than the wildest dream could have seen her
And I watch her slipping away
Though I know I'll be hunting high and low...high...
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Hunting high and low...high...
There's no end to the lengths I'll go
